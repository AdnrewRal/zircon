# Zircon
Go zero to one with Solana development, and test your skills against your peers.

## Why?
The amount of full-stack developers in the world vastly outnumber the Solana capable developers. With the right tooling, they could be acquainted with Solana relatively quickly. Additionally, it's difficult to evaluate a current Solana developer. Reading through GitHub repos is a time-consuming endeavor, and that's only if they have public repos to look at. With Zircon, we can provide another input to evaluate a developer's skills.
