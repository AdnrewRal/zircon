  <h3>The Developer Dojo for Solana.</h3>

## What is it?
Zircon is a hub for guided and gamified courses, coding challenges reminiscent of LeetCode, and a sandbox for sharing Solana-related code snippets within minutes.

## Why?
To put it simply: *I felt like this needed to exist*

I've been helping new developers learn how to build on Solana for almost two years now, and each time I've wished something like this existed to point them to. Here are a few of the thoughts behind why I built this:

- Tutorial hell is rampant in this industry. A guided course component (much like CryptoZombies & Buildspace) could help break the monotony and in-turn onboard more developers
- Evaluating potential developers requires combing their GitHub, a potentially time-consuming process
- Setting up an environment to share and run code snippets for Solana is annoying
